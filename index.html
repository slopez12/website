    Hi everyone, I'm Sara. I'm a fourth year Communication major. I've grown-up
    in Chicago's southside my entire life. I love to try out new food and visit
    different restaurants, as you can tell I'm a foodie. Another hobby of mine
    is to paint and create art pieces. I also, prefer listening then speaking
    and can be shy in many cases. I alI look forward to this class.
