    I am currently a fourth year Communication major with a minor in History at
    the Illinois Institute of Technology. I started off as a non-declared
    humanities because I didn't know where I wanted to, major and career wise.
    After doing so research on industries where my interest alined, I decided the
    closest to that was communications. My best route was general communications
    because the specializations in the major were guided towards technical or
    journalism, which was science or business. The field that I was inclined
    towards did not aligned with those specializations. Hence, my decision to go
    as a general communication major.

    In the field or industry that I am looking foward to go in, is the public
    realtions and marketing field in the beauty and fashion industry. Art has always
    been part of my extra-curricualr activites as I grew up. In high school, I took
    some fashion classes and learned that I was more interesting in the process of
    selling the piece then, making the piece. With my communciation degree and
    internships, I look foward to my carreer in my beauty and fashion industry.

    Outside of school, my interest lies in the arts. Like I mention, I have being
    doing some form of art at a very young age. I have taken a variety of art
    classes from pottery to hat making to painting. Although, I am not enrolled in
    any classes currently, I still am painting for myself or for friends.
