I am currently a fourth year Communication major with a minor in History at the
Illinois Institute of Technology. I started off as a non-declared humanities
because I didn't know where I wanted to, major and career wise. After doing so
research on industries where my interest alined, I decided the closest to that
was communications. My best route was general communications because the
specializations in the major were guided towards technical or journalism, which
was science or business. The field that I was inclined towards did not aligned
with those specializations. Hence, my decision to go as a general communication
major.

In the field or industry that I am looking foward to go in, is the public
realtions and marketing field in the beauty and fashion industry. Art has always
been part of my extra-curricualr activites as I grew up. In high school, I took
some fashion classes and learned that I was more interesting in the process of
selling the piece then, making the piece. With my communciation degree and
internships, I look foward to my carreer in my beauty and fashion industry.

Outside of school, my interest lies in the arts. Like I mention, I have being
doing some form of art at a very young age. I have taken a variety of art
classes from pottery to hat making to painting. Although, I am not enrolled in
any classes currently, I still am painting for myself or for friends.
