Hi everyone, I'm Sara. I'm a fourth year Communication major. I've grown-up in
Chicago's southside my entire life. I love to try out new food and visit
different restaurants, as you can tell I'm a foodie. Another hobby of mine is to
paint and create art pieces. I also, prefer listening then speaking and can be
shy in many cases. I alI look forward to this class.
